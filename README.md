# Overview
Implemented a basic ray tracer

The methods that implemented are marked with 'TODO' in the code. These can be found in boolean.cpp, camera.cpp, phong_shader.cpp, plane.cpp, reflective_shader.cpp, render_world.cpp, and sphere.cpp. A code skeleton and driver framework was provided by Professor Shinar(University of California Riverside).
Implemented object intersections, shading, and ray casting.

# How to Run
To run the tests, run ./ray_tracer <test-file>, where test-file is one of the provided test files. The tests can also be run with ./ray_tracer -p <test-file>, in which case the result is saved to output.png rather than rendered to the screen using OpenGL.

# Tests
Tests 1-25 should be completed. 26-37 were extra-credit.
